    "customization": "It also occurred to me that having a specific taste and a need to have my possessions customized, I can't really find easy ways to do it online other than by myself. As the option is not usually presented, people can't ask for it. Which is why I want to offer others the opportunity to have anything here customized according to their wants and needs.",
